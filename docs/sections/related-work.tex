In the past other researches already executed the comparision of OpenCL and CUDA as of \cite{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167819111001335}, 
\cite{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6047190}, \cite{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312915568_A_comprehensive_performance_comparison_of_cuda_and_opencl} or \cite{https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2581}. Since they are mostly more than 10 years old this another motivation for this report.
Nevertheless this section should give some space on their comparision and their results.
